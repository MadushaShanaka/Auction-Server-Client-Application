We used TelNet for check the server.

Once you start the server

"Client Name: " - Enter the Name of the user

"Symbol: " - Enter the Symbol you want to bid, once you enter the Existing symbol
	     it will show you the Highest bid, if you input the wrong symbol it will
	     show you error and you can enter the correct Symbol after that.


"Your bid: " - Enter the bid value you willing to bid, after that it will show you successfull bid if you enter the any value and it will again ask you for another bid , if you want to bid.


* Maybe the Highest bid value will different than last time you bid , for that you can type "price" and it will display the current highest bid for the symbol.After 
that you can enter your bid value.

* If you want to exit from server connection just type "quit".
